                        <h3>Question 1 : What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h3>
                        <P> <span class="fw-bold">Answer:</span> DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a
                            programming interface for
                            HTML that
                            allows programs to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of web
                            pages.The purpose of the DOM is to provide a platform- and language-neutral way for programs
                            to interact with the content of a web page. It represents the structure of a document as a
                            tree-like structure, with each node in the tree representing an element, attribute, or piece
                            of text. By using the DOM, programs can manipulate the content of a web page, such as adding
                            or removing elements, modifying the style of existing elements, or changing the text within
                            elements.</P>

                        <h3>Question 2:How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods</h3>
                        <p> <span class="fw-bold">Answer:</span> There are many way to select select HTML elements using
                            DOM.Most common
                            method are
                            getElementsByTagName(),getElementsByClassName(),
                            getElementById(),querySelector(),querySelectorAll()</p>

                        <h3>Question 3: What is event bubble?</h3>
                        <p> <span class="fw-bold">Answer:</span> Event bubbling is a mechanism in the Document Object
                            Model (DOM) where
                            an event that
                            is triggered on a nested element will "bubble up" through its parent elements, and
                            ultimately up to the document itself.When an event is triggered on an element, such as a
                            mouse click, the event will be handled by that element's event listener first. Then, the
                            event will be passed to the parent element's event listener, and so on, until it reaches the
                            top-level document object. This process of the event propagating through the nested elements
                            is known as event bubbling.</p>

                        <h3>Question 4:What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
                        <p><span class="fw-bold">Answer:</span> A callback function is a function that is passed as an
                            argument to another function and is
                            executed inside that function. The primary use of callback functions is to perform an action
                            after some other action has completed.In JavaScript, callbacks are used extensively in
                            asynchronous programming, where you want to execute code after a task has completed, but you
                            don't want to block the execution of other code while you wait for the task to complete.</p>
